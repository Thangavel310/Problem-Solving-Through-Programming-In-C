Week 5 : Programming Assignment 1


Write a C program to check whether a given number (N) is a perfect number or not.
[Perfect Number - A perfect number is a positive integer number which is equals to the sum of its proper positive divisors. 
For example 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3 and itâ€™s sum is equals to 6.]

C Program:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int N; 
    scanf("%d",&N); 
    int sum=0;
    for(int ik = 1; ik <= N / 2; ik++)
    {
       
        if(N%ik == 0)
        {
            sum += ik;
        }
    }
    if(sum == N && N > 0)
    {
       printf("%d is a perfect number.",N);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("%d is not a perfect number.",N);
    }
    return 0;
}




Week 5 : Programming Assignment 2


Write a C program to count total number of digits of an Integer number (N).


C Program:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int N; 
    scanf("%d",&N);
    int temp02 = N, count = 0; 
    while(temp02 > 0)
	  {
        count+=1;
        temp02/=10;
    }
    printf("The number %d contains %d digits.",N,count);
    return 0;
}    


Week 5 : Programming Assignment 3


Write a C program to check whether the given number(N) can be expressed as Power of Two (2) or not.
For example 8 can be expressed as 2^3.


#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int N;
    scanf("%d",&N);
    int t2, flag;
    t2=N;
    flag=0;

    while(t2!=1)
    {
        if(t2%2!=0)
        {
            flag=1;
            break;
        }
        t2/=2;
    }

    if(flag==0)
    {
        printf("%d is a number that can be expressed as power of 2.",N);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("%d cannot be expressed as power of 2.",N);
    }
    return 0;
}



Week 5 : Programming Assignment 4


Write a C program to find sum of following series where the value of N is taken as input


C Program:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int N;
    float sum = 0.0;
    scanf("%d",&N);
    for(int y=1;y <= N;y++)
    {
        sum+=1.0/y;
    }
    printf("Sum of the series is: %.2f",sum);
    return 0;
}
